# What do I do if I receive an eviction notice during the moratorium?  
Tenants who receive any eviction notice during the moratorium should contact the Renting in Seattle 
hotline at 206‐684‐5700 or [go online to submit a complaint](http://www.seattle.gov) (Look under +Create New and select 
Complaints).  

# Do I still have to pay my rent during the moratorium? 
Yes, tenants still have an obligation to pay their rent. If you don’t pay, balances will continue to get larger 
and you may get a notice to pay or vacate if you still owe rent after the moratorium ends. Making partial 
payments or developing a payment plan with your landlord can reduce the amount you owe at the end of 
the moratorium. Your landlord cannot charge any fees for late or partial payments during the moratorium.  

If you are having problems paying rent, you can call 211 or look at the resource links below. 

# If my rental agreement expires during the moratorium, do I still have to move out? 
Yes. The moratorium does not extend your rental agreement.  However, if you do not move, you cannot be 
evicted until after the moratorium ends.  

# Can I be evicted for violating my rental agreement during the moratorium?   
During the moratorium, you can only be evicted for an imminent threat to the health or safety of others. . 
After the moratorium ends, the landlord can issue notices and evict you for other violations of the rental 
agreement.  

# What can I do if the landlord started my eviction case before the moratorium?  
Tenants can raise the moratorium as a defense in court to an eviction action and courts may grant a 
continuance on an eviction hearing to occur after the moratorium. If you have received a summons and 
complaint, a court order scheduling an eviction hearing, or a writ of restitution, you can contact either the 
Housing Justice Project at 253‐234‐4204 or the Tenant Law Center at (206) 324‐6890 for  legal assistance 
over the phone.
